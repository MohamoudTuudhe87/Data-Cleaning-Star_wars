# Data Cleaning Star Wars
This repository contains my completed Data Cleaning Star Wars project, a guided challenge from Dataquest based on the Star Wars Survey. This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing data from a survey on Star Wars movies and fan preferences, with the primary goal of demonstrating comprehensive data cleaning skills.

## Project Overview
The Data Cleaning Star Wars project involves working with a dataset containing responses from Star Wars fans about their viewing preferences, favorite characters, and ratings of each movie. This project highlights the process of handling real-world messy data and transforming it into a form ready for exploratory analysis.

### Link to Original Challenge
This project is based on Dataquestâ€™s [Star Wars Survey](https://app.dataquest.io/m/201/guided-project%3A-star-wars-survey/1/how-guided-projects-work) guided project.

## Key Objectives
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing data, transforming data types, renaming columns, and standardizing text fields.
- **Data Wrangling:** Restructuring the dataset for efficient analysis, addressing inconsistencies, and applying transformations.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducting EDA to uncover patterns, trends, and interesting insights in Star Wars fandom.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset contains survey responses on various aspects of Star Wars movies, such as:
- Movie viewing history and ratings
- Favorite and least favorite characters
- Demographic information of survey respondents
The original dataset required significant cleaning, as it contained inconsistent data formats, ambiguous column names, and missing values.

### Project Workflow
**Data Loading:** Importing the dataset and conducting an initial assessment.  
**Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handling null values by either filling, removing, or marking them as needed.  
   - Converting columns to appropriate data types (e.g., float, int, object).   
   - Renaming columns for clarity and consistency.   
   - Standardizing categorical data to avoid discrepancies in text responses.

**Data Transformation:** Restructuring data for easy analysis by splitting or combining columns as needed.   
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performing EDA to generate insights about Star Wars movie preferences among fans, including:      
   - Most viewed movies  
   - Highest-rated movies and characters  
   - Demographic trends in fan preferences  
## Results and Insights
This analysis provided several interesting findings, such as:

- **Popular Movies:** The most-watched Star Wars movies among survey respondents.
- **Character Preferences:** Identifying the most and least favorite characters.
- **Demographic Trends:** Exploring how age, gender, and other demographics relate to Star Wars preferences.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical data cleaning techniques essential for handling real-world survey data, especially when working with inconsistent responses. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in transforming a messy dataset into a structured and insightful analysis, enhancing my skills in data wrangling, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis.
